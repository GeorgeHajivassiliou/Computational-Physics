You will find two Python 3.6 notebooks, one named Quadrature_Methods.ipynb
and the other Monte_Carlo_Methods.ipynb. Each one does what the name suggests.
In both files you will see the implemantiation of the relevant algorithms,
a way to validate them (simply choose to run the functions with the quadratic provided
- whose integral is exactly 8) and in the end a way to record some data for analysis.
The funtions are called with a few variations of the parameters for testing but
these are obviously not all the calls that where made during the design of this
project. Please feel free to call the functions with any parameters you consider necessary.
