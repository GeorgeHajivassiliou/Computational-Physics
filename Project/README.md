# COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS PROJECT 2

This has an investigation into numerical integration.

You will find two Python 3.6 notebooks, one named __Quadrature_Methods.ipynb__ and the other __Monte_Carlo_Methods.ipynb__. As the names suggest, the fisrt one concerns integrations using Quandrature methods and the second concerns Monter Carlo.

In both files you will see the implemantiation of the relevant algorithms,a way to validate them (simply choose to run the functions with the quadratic provided - whose integral is exactly 8) and in the end a way to record some data for analysis.The funtions are called with a few variations of the parameters for testing but these are obviously not all the calls that were made during the design of this project.

Please feel free to call the functions with any parameters you consider necessary.
