# Computational-Physics

This is work undertaken under my Computational Physics course are Imperial College.


This was a large course that covered the following topics:

- Basics of numerical programming. Variable types, floating point and integer arithmetic,
numerical accuracy and error propagation, root-finding.
- Linear matrix algebra. Iterative methods for solution of linear equations.
- Interpolation. How to represent a functional form in a computer, given a finite number of
data points.
- Fourier transform methods and their use in data processing.
- Random numbers. How random number generators work and how to use them to generate
non-uniform random number distributions.
- Monte Carlo methods for integration, minimisation and simulating equilibria of ensembles of
particles.
- Optimisation methods. Methods for finding the minimum and maxima of general multidimensional functions.
- Finite difference methods. Theory and analysis of the accuracy and stability of numerical
methods for solving differential equations.
- Solution of initial-value and boundary-value ordinary differential equations using finite difference methods.
- Numerical Integration. Deterministic rules, evaluation of improper and bady-behaved integrals, ODE methods
- Solution of initial-value parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations using finite
difference methods.
